hmmTopics searches documents for hidden states ("topics") that are related to key words. Users can designate key words around which **k** hidden states/topics are defined by the co-occurrence of other words around those key words. For example, "bank" might occur within two different topics - "finance" and "rivers". Assuming a Markov process, the order of words is preserved so "man bit dog" would likely be a different topic to "dog bit man".
